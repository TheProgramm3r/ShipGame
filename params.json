{"name":"Tarbeyon","tagline":"WIP RPG Game - Feature Request Here: http://tinyurl.com/TarbeyonFeatureRequest","body":"Tarbeyon\r\n========\r\nTarbeyon is an adventure/RPG/Sandbox game, revolving around the game mechanic where you can never save a world file, only the inventory. Features are constantly being added, as there are very few of them at the moment.\r\n\r\nNote: this game currently requires Python version 3.3, as well as Pygame 1.9.2. It may work with other versions of Python, as long as the version is 3.0+ and you have the correct version of Pygame installed, as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help that everyone has given, and thank you to the rest of the Vanilla Indie Development team, two members in particular.\r\n","google":"UA-46921499-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
