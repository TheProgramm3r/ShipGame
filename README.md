Tarbeyon
========

Note: this project is no longer being maintained.

Tarbeyon is an adventure/RPG/Sandbox game, revolving around the game mechanic where you can never save a world file, only the inventory.

Note: this game currently requires Python version 3.3, as well as Pygame 1.9.2. It may work with other versions of Python, as long as the version is 3.0+ and you have the correct version of Pygame installed, as well.
